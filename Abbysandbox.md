# Space radiation
### Source and Forms

Space radiation is, simply put, atoms which have had their atoms stripped away as they approach the speed of light. This radiation is constantly flooding into space, and has three main forms when we encounter it. These are 1 - particles which are trapped in Earth's magnetic field, 2), particles shot into space during solar flares, and 3), galactic cosmic rays. (new band name, right? High energy protons and heavy ions which from outside of our solar system.)

## Actual work
### Exercise
In space, exercise is crucial to prevent deterioration of muscles, bones and ligaments, or osteoporis and cardiovascular dysfunction. These are (you guessed it) bad. Without proper diet and fitness regimens, bone density can decrease by 1% to 2% for every month in microgravity, and the heart is worked less heartily because of cephalad fluid lifts (aka blood isn't pulled down to your feet so you cardiac muscles don't pump as hard. This can lead to the weakening of cardiac muscles.)
