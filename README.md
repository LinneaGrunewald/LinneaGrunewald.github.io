Welcome to the website. If you're going to be sticking around, please don't delete anything new.

So to make a website you're going to need to know some basics. Fool around on this website first, and later on I'll set up another one.

```

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link Text](url) and ![Tooltip cannot be blank](image identifier) >> Be sure to upload your image to the repository first!

```
All that code ends up looking like this:

By the way, the roman is watching you. He wants to make a website too but I don't have time to teach him so he just watches people edit the repository until he learns something.
